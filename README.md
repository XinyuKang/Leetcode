Python Tricks:

Dictionary: 
Unordered key-value pair. The functionality of both dictionaries and defaultdict are almost same except for the fact that defaultdict never raises a KeyError. It provides a default value for the key that does not exists (each key has the same default value). e.g. defaultdict(int) returns a dictionary with all default value 0.

Counter: 
Count several repeated objects at once. Returns a python dictionary with the counts of each letter. The .update() implementation provided by Counter adds existing counts together.
